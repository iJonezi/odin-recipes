# odin-recipes

A website made using The Odin Project's tutorial under the "Foundations Recipes" section.

From this section, I aim to learn more foundations involving the HTML language as well as practice using GitHub commits.

<!--- What I've Learned --->

From this lesson, I've learned the following:
-Use of href/src for anchors/images
-Use of OL and UL for organized/unorganized lists
-Linking webpages together through hyperlinks
-Scaling images using width and height using HTML(not css)
-Different sizes of headers(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
-Understanding of required HTML code for projects, such as !DOCTYPE and META.
