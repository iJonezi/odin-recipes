# Odin-recipes

A website made using The Odin Project's tutorial under the "Foundations Recipes" section.

From this section, I aim to learn more foundations involving the HTML language as well as practice using GitHub commits.

<!--- What I've Learned --->

From this lesson, I've initial learned the following:

<ul>
    <li>Use of href/src for anchors/images</li>
    <li>Use of OL and UL for organized/unorganized lists</li>
    <li>Linking webpages together through hyperlinks</li>
    <li>Scaling images using width and height using HTML(not css)</li>
    <li>Different sizes of headers(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)</li>
    <li>Understanding of required HTML code for projects, such as !DOCTYPE and META.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Progression...</h1>

After the above learnings, I later started to implement versions of CSS and JavaScript into the recipe website.

With these changes, I've learned the foundations needed for CSS Styling, JavaScript is soon to come.
